 - is able to calculate the time from today until a given date, outputs the delta
 - is able to output the delta in full, only seconds, only day, only years

Please keep in mind:
- **no new concepts**. (functions, classes, **none** of that)
- Choose your presenter(s) **beforehand**
- Create an excalidraw board to present (or something similar)
- while presenting a topic, zoom in on only the topic
- keep the board **simple**, avoid walls of text
